        <h2>Coral Bleaching Facts and Consequences</h2>
        <p>Six facts about coral bleaching!
          
            Coral and Algae depend on each other to survive.
            Coral have a symbiotic relationship with microscopic algae called zooxanthellae that live in their tissue.
            These algae are the coral's primary food source and give them their color.
            Stressed Coral: If stressed, algae leaves the coral.
            When symbiotic relationship becomes stressed due to increased ocean temperature or pollution, the algae leave the coral's tissue.
            Bleached coral: Coral is left bleached and vulnerable. Without the algae, the coral loses its major source of food, turns white or very pale, and is more susceptible to disease.

        <p>Causes of bleaching!
            Change in ocean temperature caused by climate change is leading caused of coral bleaching. 
            Runoff, pollution, and storm generated precipitation can rapidly dilute ocean water while the runoff carry pollutants - bleaching near-shore corals.
            Overexposure to sunlight: When temperature are high, high solar irradiance contributes to bleaching in shallow-water corals.
